# mmap.js

Working `mmap()` binding for node.js

This version taken from https://github.com/indutny/mmap.js and modified works also under Windows.

## API

```js
const mmap = require('mmap.js');

// Allocate chunk of memory, see `man 2 mmap`
const buf = mmap.alloc(
    mmap.PAGE_SIZE /* len */,
    mmap.PROT_READ | mmap.PROT_WRITE /* prot */,
    mmap.MAP_ANON | mmap.MAP_PRIVATE /* flags */,
    -1 /* fd */,
    0 /* offset */);

// File mapping:
const fd = fs.openSync(this.file2, 'r+');
const fileBuf = mmap.alloc(
    mmap.PAGE_SIZE * 4,
    mmap.PROT_READ | mmap.PROT_WRITE,
    mmap.MAP_SHARED,
    fd,
    0);
fs.closeSync(fd);

// Syncing data
mmap.sync(fileBuf, 0 /* off */, mmap.PAGE_SIZE /* len */,
          mmap.MS_SYNC /* flags, default: MS_SYNC */)

// Allocating memory with aligned address (low bits set to 0)
const abuf = mmap.alignedAlloc(
    mmap.PAGE_SIZE,
    mmap.PROT_READ | mmap.PROT_WRITE,
    mmap.MAP_ANON | mmap.MAP_PRIVATE,
    -1,
    0,
    1024 * 1024 /* alignment value, address will be a multiple of it */);
```
